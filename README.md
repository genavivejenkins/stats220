# Hello there! 

* The purpose of this repo is *mainly* to get the first step of project 1 out of the way.
* It also serves as a nice introduction into this side of statistics that I am honestly not too familiar with.

## A few facts about me :) 

1. I had absolutely **NO** interest in majoring in stats and only took 101 as it was a compulsory course for my psych degree, but ended up *really* enjoying it and here we are!
2. I recently delved into mario kart and have only won an online race **ONCE** since I first started playing about two months ago.
